# Regular Expressions in JavaScript

This project is all about Regular Expressions and using them in JavaScript.

## 1. Getting Started

In JavaScript, Regular Expressions are Objects.

There are two ways to create RegEx Objects:

```
const regex1 = new RegExp("hello")

const regex2 = /world/
```

Once created, RegEx objects can be used with methods on both the RegEx Object and the String wrapper object.
